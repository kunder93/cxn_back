/**
 * Contains response DTOs for team-related operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package defines data transfer objects (DTOs) used to encapsulate
 * responses related to team entities. These objects are used to structure data
 * returned by the backend when handling team-related API requests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The response DTOs in this package facilitate the serialization and
 * deserialization of team-related information, ensuring a clear separation
 * between internal models and external API contracts.
