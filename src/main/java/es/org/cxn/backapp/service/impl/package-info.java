/**
 * Provides implementations of the services defined in the
 * {@link es.org.cxn.backapp.service} package.
 * <p>
 * This package contains the concrete classes that implement the various service
 * interfaces for handling business logic related to payments, federate states,
 * and other operations within the application. The services are responsible for
 * interacting with the data layer, processing data, and performing operations
 * such as creating, updating, and deleting records, as well as managing payment
 * states and user-related functionalities.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation classes in this package are typically used by the
 * controllers or other components in the application to handle service-related
 * tasks. Each service class encapsulates specific business logic and provides
 * methods for interacting with the corresponding repository or data layer.
 * </p>
