/**
 * This package contains integration tests for service layer classes within the
 * application, specifically focusing on the default implementations of various
 * core services.
 *
 * <p>The services tested in this package include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.service.DefaultLibraryService}: This service
 *   handles operations related to the management of the application's
 *   library resources.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.service.DefaultRoleService}: This service
 *   is responsible for managing roles within the application's
 *   security framework.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each test class within this package ensures that the respective services
 * function correctly when integrated with other parts of the application,
 * such as the data access layer and security components.</p>
 *
 * <p>The tests are designed to validate both typical usage scenarios and
 * edge cases, ensuring that the services are robust and reliable in
 * a production environment.</p>
