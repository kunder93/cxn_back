/**
 * Contains integration tests for various controllers in the back application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes tests that verify the functionality of different
 * RESTful controllers in the application. Each test class focuses on a specific
 * controller and its endpoints to ensure that they behave as expected when
 * interacting with the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following test classes are included in this package:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.AdressControllerIntegrationIT}</li>
 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.AuthControllerIntegrationIT}</li>
 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.ChessQuestionsControllerIT}</li>
 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.CompanyControllerIntegrationTest}</li>

 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.RoleControllerIntegrationIT}</li>
 * <li>{@link es.org.cxn.backapp.test.integration.controller.UserControllerIntegrationIT}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These integration tests aim to validate the correct functionality of the API
 * endpoints defined in each controller, including the handling of various
 * request types and responses.
