/**
 * Contains unit tests for controllers and security configurations.
 * <p>
 * This package includes tests for various controllers within the application,
 * such as the {@link es.org.cxn.backapp.controller.ChessQuestionsController}
 * and {@link es.org.cxn.backapp.controller.LibraryController}. It also
 * includes tests for security configurations managed by
 * {@link es.org.cxn.backapp.config.TestSecurityConfiguration}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The tests verify the correct behavior and functionality of these components,
 * ensuring that they handle requests properly and enforce security policies.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The unit tests are designed to be executed in isolation from other parts
 * of the system, using mocks and stubs to simulate various scenarios and
 * edge cases.
 * </p>
