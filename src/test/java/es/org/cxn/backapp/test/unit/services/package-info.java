/**
 * Provides unit tests for the services in the application.
 *
 * This package contains test classes for verifying the functionality of
 * different service components. These tests are meant to ensure that the
 * service layers function correctly and handle various edge cases.
 *
 * <p>The specific test classes included in this package are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChessQuestionServiceTest} - Tests for the {@link
 *         es.org.cxn.backapp.services.ChessQuestionService} class.
 *         Ensures that the chess question service behaves as expected,
 *         including creating, retrieving, and managing chess questions.</li>
 *     <li>{@link UserServiceTest} - Tests for the {@link
 *         es.org.cxn.backapp.services.DefaultUserService} class. Verifies
 *         the correctness of user-related operations such as user creation,
 *         updating user details, and user authentication.</li>
 *     <li>{@link PaymentSheetServiceTest} - Tests for the {@link
 *         es.org.cxn.backapp.services.PaymentSheetService} class. Ensures
 *         the payment sheet service functions correctly, including handling
 *         payment processing and generating payment sheets.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * All tests in this package are designed to be unit tests, focusing on
 * individual units of functionality and ensuring that each service performs
 * as expected in isolation.
