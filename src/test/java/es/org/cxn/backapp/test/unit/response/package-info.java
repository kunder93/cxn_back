/**
 * Contains unit test classes for response-related components of the
 *  application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes tests for various response classes to ensure that they
 * behave correctly and adhere to the expected format. The classes in
 *  this package typically test the serialization, deserialization, and
 *  the integrity of response data structures.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Specifically, this package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChessQuestionResponseTest} - Tests for the ChessQuestion
 *     response class.</li>
 *     <li>{@link InvoiceListResponseTest} - Tests for the InvoiceList
 *     response class.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These tests are part of the unit testing suite to validate the response
 * structures in isolation from other components of the application.
 * </p>
